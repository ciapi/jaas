# Problem

Resilient & Resource-efficient infra is a necessity for businesses and organizations.

Apache Mesos & Apache Aurora are FOSS which could help provide Resilient & Resource-efficient cluster-managed infra-structure.

#Goal

Jazz when complete would be an API first installable with containers as first class citizens.

#Motivation

eBay had solved this problem https://youtu.be/VZPbLUJnR68 using Mesos. However Mesos's components are prone to failure and eBay's solution is not open sourced when this document was created.

This project would be an open source API first resilent-cloud experience for enterprises to install and maintain, with following attributes

1. Elastic
2. Reliable
3. Efficient

> *How* ?
MAZ (Mesos+Aurora+Zookeeper) would provide Jenkins Resilience
MAZ on Kubernetes will provide MAZ Resilience.

#Use Cases

* Resilient Jenkins
